## Introduction

Understanding musical preferences based on demographic data is an interesting problem. The Music Genre Predictor project attempts to solve this problem using a decision tree-based machine learning model. By providing age and gender data, the model can predict the likely genre preferences of a listener.

## Features

- Predict music genres based on age and gender inputs.
- Explore the relationship between demographics and music preferences.
- Jupyter notebook with the machine learning code is included.

## Getting Started

To use the Music Genre Predictor and explore the machine learning model, follow these steps:

1. Open the Jupyter notebook file, `Music_Genre_Predictor.ipynb`, to view the code and run the model.

2. Provide age and gender inputs to the model to predict music genres.

3. Analyze the results and explore the relationship between demographics and music preferences.
